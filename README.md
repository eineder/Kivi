This repository is going to be used to develop a key-value store that can be hosted as a cloud service and used via a REST API.
Motivation: I want to learn about databases, B trees, atomicity, distributed storages. As I also want to improve my Golang skills, I will use it for this project.
I want to start with something very easy (an in-memory dictionary with a simple API on top), and then add persistence, optimizaitons and distributed storage later on.
